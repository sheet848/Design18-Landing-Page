# Design 18 Landing Page

## The Objective
- This project was created to familiarize myself with **Tailwind CSS** and **React** apply classes for the quick creation of basic UI components.
- The design was taken from Figma community account **[@workpoturem](https://www.figma.com/@workpoturem)**
- The design file used : **[Click here](https://www.figma.com/design/0RruyhdHyexaQ2S0LNvNx5/High-Landing-(the18.design)-Free-(Community)?node-id=1214-33134&t=RKp7WRFqpAC15wRW-0)**

## Features
- This is a simple basic Landing page created using React
- The landing page has a **workable navigation bar** and a **single selection accordion**

## Approach
- All images and content used in this page are extracted from the **[constants page](https://github.com/sheet848/Design18-Landing-Page/blob/main/src/constant/index.jsx)** to the React component page.
- Due to this, additional content can be added to the current components without changing the logic used in the JSX.
- The styling is done via **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Mobile first CSS** was executed for this page, which on executing found that the page styling time reduced considerably.
